Apple and its high-technology peers — as well as dozens of other American industries — have achieved a pace of innovation nearly unmatched in modern history.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="313" data-total-count="1792" itemprop="articleBody">However, the workers assembling iPhones, iPads and other devices often labor in harsh conditions, according to employees inside those plants, worker advocates and documents published by companies themselves. Problems are as varied as onerous work environments and serious — sometimes deadly — safety problems.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="448" data-total-count="2240" itemprop="articleBody">Employees work excessive overtime, in some cases seven days a week, and live in crowded dorms. Some say they stand so long that their legs swell until they can hardly walk. Under-age workers have helped build Apple’s products, and the company’s suppliers have improperly disposed of hazardous waste and falsified records, according to company reports and advocacy groups that, within China, are often considered reliable, independent monitors.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="515" data-total-count="2755" itemprop="articleBody">More troubling, the groups say, is some suppliers’ disregard for workers’ health. Two years ago, 137 workers at an Apple supplier in eastern China were injured after they were ordered to use a poisonous chemical to clean <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/iphone/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="Recent and archival news about the iPhone." class="meta-classifier">iPhone</a> screens. Within seven months last year, two explosions at iPad factories, including in Chengdu, killed four people and injured 77. Before those blasts, Apple had been alerted to hazardous conditions inside the Chengdu plant, according to a Chinese group that <a title="The group’s report (PDF)." href="http://sacom.hk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/2011-05-06_foxconn-and-apple-fail-to-fulfill-promises.pdf">published that warning</a>.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="370" data-total-count="3125" itemprop="articleBody">“If Apple was warned, and didn’t act, that’s reprehensible,” said Nicholas Ashford, a former chairman of the National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and Health, a group that advises the United States Labor Department. “But what’s morally repugnant in one country is accepted business practices in another, and companies take advantage of that.”</p><div  class="ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"><div class="accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden">

</div><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="258" data-total-count="3383" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-3">Apple is not the only electronics company doing business within a troubling supply system. Bleak working conditions have been documented at factories manufacturing products for Dell, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Lenovo, Motorola, Nokia, Sony, Toshiba and others.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="370" data-total-count="3753" itemprop="articleBody">Current and former Apple executives, moreover, say the company has made significant strides in improving factories in recent years. Apple has a <a title="Apple’s code of conduct for suppliers." href="http://www.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/code-of-conduct/">supplier code of conduct</a> that details standards on labor issues, safety protections and other topics. The company has mounted a vigorous auditing campaign, and when abuses are discovered, Apple says, corrections are demanded.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="195" data-total-count="3948" itemprop="articleBody">And Apple’s annual <a title="Apple’s supplier responsibility program." href="http://www.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/">supplier responsibility reports</a>, in many cases, are the first to report abuses. This month, for the first time, the company <a title="A related article on Apple’s suppliers." href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/14/technology/apple-releases-list-of-its-suppliers-for-the-first-time.html">released a list</a> identifying many of its suppliers.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="345" data-total-count="4293" itemprop="articleBody">But significant problems remain. More than half of the suppliers audited by Apple have violated at least one aspect of the code of conduct every year since 2007, according to Apple’s reports, and in some instances have violated the law. While many violations involve working conditions, rather than safety hazards, troubling patterns persist.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="354" data-total-count="4647" itemprop="articleBody">“Apple never cared about anything other than increasing product quality and decreasing production cost,” said Li Mingqi, who until April worked in management at <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/foxconn_technology/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Foxconn Technology." class="meta-org">Foxconn Technology</a>, one of Apple’s most important manufacturing partners. Mr. Li, who is suing Foxconn over his dismissal, helped manage the Chengdu factory where the explosion occurred.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="74" data-total-count="4721" itemprop="articleBody">“Workers’ welfare has nothing to do with their interests,” he said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="516" data-total-count="5237" itemprop="articleBody">Some former Apple executives say there is an unresolved tension within the company: executives want to improve conditions within factories, but that dedication falters when it conflicts with crucial supplier relationships or the fast delivery of new products. Tuesday, <a title="A link to an article on Apple’s quarterly earnings." href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/25/technology/apples-profit-doubles-as-holiday-customers-snapped-up-iphones.html">Apple reported</a> one of the most lucrative quarters of any corporation in history, with $13.06 billion in profits on $46.3 billion in sales. Its sales would have been even higher, executives said, if overseas factories had been able to produce more.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="217" data-total-count="5454" itemprop="articleBody">Executives at other corporations report similar internal pressures. This system may not be pretty, they argue, but a radical overhaul would slow innovation. Customers want amazing new electronics delivered every year.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="368" data-total-count="5822" itemprop="articleBody">“We’ve known about labor abuses in some factories for four years, and they’re still going on,” said one former Apple executive who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. “Why? Because the system works for us. Suppliers would change everything tomorrow if Apple told them they didn’t have another choice.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="121" data-total-count="5943" itemprop="articleBody">“If half of iPhones were malfunctioning, do you think Apple would let it go on for four years?” the executive asked.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="661" data-total-count="6604" itemprop="articleBody">Apple, in its published reports, has said it requires every discovered labor violation to be remedied, and suppliers that refuse are terminated. Privately, however, some former executives concede that finding new suppliers is time-consuming and costly. Foxconn is one of the few manufacturers in the world with the scale to build sufficient numbers of iPhones and iPads. So Apple is “not going to leave Foxconn and they’re not going to leave China,” said Heather White, a research fellow at Harvard and a former member of the Monitoring International Labor Standards committee at the National Academy of Sciences. “There’s a lot of rationalization.”</p><div id="Moses" class="ad moses-ad nocontent robots-nocontent"><div class="accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden">

Inside, workers were building Apple’s latest, potentially greatest product: the iPad.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="489" data-total-count="9606" itemprop="articleBody">When Mr. Lai finally landed a job repairing machines at the plant, one of the first things he noticed were the almost blinding lights. Shifts ran 24 hours a day, and the factory was always bright. At any moment, there were thousands of workers standing on assembly lines or sitting in backless chairs, crouching next to large machinery, or jogging between loading bays. Some workers’ legs swelled so much they waddled. “It’s hard to stand all day,” said Zhao Sheng, a plant worker.</p><div  class="ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"><div class="accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden">

But at Foxconn, some worked more, according to interviews, workers’ pay stubs and surveys by outside groups. Mr. Lai was soon spending 12 hours a day, six days a week inside the factory, according to his paychecks. Employees who arrived late were sometimes required to write confession letters and copy quotations. There were “continuous shifts,” when workers were told to work two stretches in a row, according to interviews.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="337" data-total-count="10641" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Lai’s college degree enabled him to earn a salary of around $22 a day, including overtime — more than many others. When his days ended, he would retreat to a small bedroom just big enough for a mattress, wardrobe and a desk where he obsessively played an online game called Fight the Landlord, said his girlfriend, Luo Xiaohong.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="574" data-total-count="11215" itemprop="articleBody">Those accommodations were better than many of the company’s dorms, where 70,000 Foxconn workers lived, at times stuffed 20 people to a three-room apartment, employees said. Last year, a dispute over paychecks set off a riot in one of the dormitories, and workers started throwing bottles, trash cans and flaming paper from their windows, according to witnesses. Two hundred police officers wrestled with workers, arresting eight. Afterward, trash cans were removed, and piles of rubbish — and rodents — became a problem. Mr. Lai felt lucky to have a place of his own.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="473" data-total-count="11688" itemprop="articleBody">Foxconn, in a statement, disputed workers’ accounts of continuous shifts, extended overtime, crowded living accommodations and the causes of the riot. The company said that its operations adhered to customers’ codes of conduct, industry standards and national laws. “Conditions at Foxconn are anything but harsh,” the company wrote. Foxconn also said that it had never been cited by a customer or government for under-age or overworked employees or toxic exposures.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="346" data-total-count="12034" itemprop="articleBody">“All assembly line employees are given regular breaks, including one-hour lunch breaks,” the company wrote, and only 5 percent of assembly line workers are required to stand to carry out their tasks.

Other companies had created codes of conduct to police their suppliers. It was time, Apple decided, to follow suit.

</div><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="421" data-total-count="13168" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-7">But the next year, a British newspaper, The Mail on Sunday, <a title="The Mail on Sunday article on Foxconn." href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-401234/The-stark-reality-iPods-Chinese-factories.html">secretly visited a Foxconn factory</a> in Shenzhen, China, where iPods were manufactured, and reported on workers’ long hours, push-ups meted out as punishment and crowded dorms. Executives in Cupertino were shocked. “Apple is filled with really good people who had no idea this was going on,” a former employee said. “We wanted it changed, immediately.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="421" data-total-count="13589" itemprop="articleBody">Apple audited that factory, the company’s first such inspection, and ordered improvements. Executives also undertook a series of initiatives that included an annual audit report, first published in 2007. By last year, Apple had inspected 396 facilities — including the company’s direct suppliers, as well as many of those suppliers’ suppliers — one of the largest such programs within the electronics industry.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="413" data-total-count="14002" itemprop="articleBody">Those audits have found consistent violations of Apple’s code of conduct, <a title="Apple’s reports on its suppliers." href="http://www.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/reports.html">according to summaries</a> published by the company. In 2007, for instance, Apple conducted over three dozen audits, two-thirds of which indicated that employees regularly worked more than 60 hours a week. In addition, there were six “core violations,” the most serious kind, including hiring 15-year-olds as well as falsifying records.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="519" data-total-count="14521" itemprop="articleBody">Over the next three years, Apple conducted 312 audits, and every year, about half or more showed evidence of large numbers of employees laboring more than six days a week as well as working extended overtime. Some workers received less than minimum wage or had pay withheld as punishment. Apple found 70 core violations over that period, including cases of involuntary labor, under-age workers, record falsifications, improper disposal of hazardous waste and over a hundred workers injured by toxic chemical exposures.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="515" data-total-count="15036" itemprop="articleBody">Last year, the company conducted 229 audits. There were slight improvements in some categories and the detected rate of core violations declined. However, within 93 facilities, at least half of workers exceeded the 60-hours-a-week work limit. At a similar number, employees worked more than six days a week. There were incidents of discrimination, improper safety precautions, failure to pay required overtime rates and other violations. That year, four employees were killed and 77 injured in workplace explosions.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="375" data-total-count="15411" itemprop="articleBody">“If you see the same pattern of problems, year after year, that means the company’s ignoring the issue rather than solving it,” said one former Apple executive with firsthand knowledge of the supplier responsibility group. “Noncompliance is tolerated, as long as the suppliers promise to try harder next time. If we meant business, core violations would disappear.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="271" data-total-count="15682" itemprop="articleBody">Apple says that when an audit reveals a violation, the company requires suppliers to address the problem within 90 days and make changes to prevent a recurrence. “If a supplier is unwilling to change, we terminate our relationship,” <a title="Apple’s page on supplier audits." href="http://www.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/auditing.html">the company says</a> on its Web site.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="221" data-total-count="15903" itemprop="articleBody">The seriousness of that threat, however, is unclear. Apple has found violations in hundreds of audits, but fewer than 15 suppliers have been terminated for transgressions since 2007, according to former Apple executives.</p><div  class="ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"><div class="accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden">

Mr. Li spent seven years with Foxconn in Shenzhen and Chengdu and was forced out in April after he objected to a relocation to Chengdu, he said. Foxconn disputed his comments, and said “both Foxconn and Apple take the welfare of our employees very seriously.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="377" data-total-count="16770" itemprop="articleBody">Apple’s efforts have spurred some changes. Facilities that were reaudited “showed continued performance improvements and better working conditions,” the company wrote in its <a title="The 2011 progress report (PDF)." href="http://images.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/pdf/Apple_SR_2011_Progress_Report.pdf">2011 supplier responsibility progress report</a>.

A few years ago, after auditors insisted on interviewing low-level factory employees, they discovered that some had been forced to pay onerous “recruitment fees” — which Apple classifies as involuntary labor. As of last year, the company had forced suppliers to reimburse more than $6.7 million in such charges.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="224" data-total-count="17424" itemprop="articleBody">“Apple is a leader in preventing under-age labor,” said Dionne Harrison of Impactt, a firm paid by Apple to help prevent and respond to <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/child_labor/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about child labor." class="meta-classifier">child labor</a> among its suppliers. “They’re doing as much as they possibly can.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="27" data-total-count="17451" itemprop="articleBody">Other consultants disagree.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="335" data-total-count="17786" itemprop="articleBody">“We’ve spent years telling Apple there are serious problems and recommending changes,” said a consultant at BSR — also known as Business for Social Responsibility — which has been twice retained by Apple to provide advice on labor issues. “They don’t want to pre-empt problems, they just want to avoid embarrassments.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="32" data-total-count="17818" itemprop="articleBody"><strong> ‘We Could Have Saved Lives’</strong></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="284" data-total-count="18102" itemprop="articleBody">In 2006, BSR, along with a division of the World Bank and other groups, initiated a project to improve working conditions in factories building cellphones and other devices in China and elsewhere.

First Foxconn asked to shift from installing new hotlines to evaluating existing hotlines. Then Foxconn insisted that mental health counseling be excluded. Foxconn asked participants to sign agreements saying they would not disclose what they observed, and then rewrote those agreements multiple times. Finally, an agreement was struck, and the project was scheduled to begin in January 2008. A day before the start, Foxconn demanded more changes, until it was clear the project would not proceed, according to the consultant and a 2008 summary by BSR that did not name Foxconn.</p><div  class="ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"><div class="accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden">

Over the next two years, at least 18 other Foxconn workers attempted suicide or fell from buildings in manners that suggested suicide attempts. In 2010, two years after the pilot program fell apart and after multiple suicide attempts, Foxconn created a dedicated mental health hotline and began offering free psychological counseling.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="379" data-total-count="19945" itemprop="articleBody">“We could have saved lives, and we asked Apple to pressure Foxconn, but they wouldn’t do it,” said the BSR consultant, who asked not to be identified because of confidentiality agreements. “Companies like H.P. and Intel and Nike push their suppliers.

The iPad had gone on sale just weeks earlier, and workers were told thousands of cases needed to be polished each day. The factory was frantic, employees said. Rows of machines buffed cases as masked employees pushed buttons. Large air ducts hovered over each station, but they could not keep up with the three lines of machines polishing nonstop. Aluminum dust was everywhere.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="222" data-total-count="26570" itemprop="articleBody">Dust is a known safety hazard.

Over 90 percent of his body had been seared. “My mom ran away from the room at the first sight of him. I cried. Nobody could stand it,” his brother said.

But do you know how easy dust is to control? It’s called ventilation. We solved this problem over a century ago.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="445" data-total-count="29659" itemprop="articleBody">In its most recent supplier responsibility report, Apple wrote that while the explosions both involved combustible aluminum dust, the causes were different. The company declined, however, to provide details. The report added that Apple had now audited all suppliers polishing aluminum products and had put stronger precautions in place. All suppliers have initiated required countermeasures, except one, which remains shut down, the report said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="204" data-total-count="29863" itemprop="articleBody">For Mr. Lai’s family, questions remain. “We’re really not sure why he died,” said Mr. Lai’s mother, standing beside a shrine she built near their home. “We don’t understand what happened.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="26" data-total-count="29889" itemprop="articleBody"><strong> Hitting the Apple Lottery</strong></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="485" data-total-count="30374" itemprop="articleBody">Every year, as rumors about Apple’s forthcoming products start to emerge, trade publications and Web sites begin speculating about which suppliers are likely to win the Apple lottery. Getting a contract from Apple can lift a company’s value by millions because of the implied endorsement of manufacturing quality. But few companies openly brag about the work: Apple generally requires suppliers to sign contracts promising they will not divulge anything, including the partnership.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="190" data-total-count="30564" itemprop="articleBody">That lack of transparency gives Apple an edge at keeping its plans secret. But it also has been a barrier to improving working conditions, according to advocates and former Apple executives.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="302" data-total-count="30866" itemprop="articleBody">This month, after numerous requests by advocacy and news organizations, including The New York Times, <a title="The Times article on the suppliers." href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/14/technology/apple-releases-list-of-its-suppliers-for-the-first-time.html">Apple released</a> the names of 156 of its suppliers. In the report accompanying that list, Apple said they “account for more than 97 percent of what we pay to suppliers to manufacture our products.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="420" data-total-count="31286" itemprop="articleBody">However, the company has not revealed the names of hundreds of other companies that do not directly contract with Apple, but supply the suppliers. The company’s supplier list does not disclose where factories are, and many are hard to find. And independent monitoring organizations say when they have tried to inspect Apple’s suppliers, they have been barred from entry — on Apple’s orders, they have been told.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="434" data-total-count="31720" itemprop="articleBody">“We’ve had this conversation hundreds of times,” said a former executive in Apple’s supplier responsibility group. “There is a genuine, companywide commitment to the code of conduct. But taking it to the next level and creating real change conflicts with secrecy and business goals, and so there’s only so far we can go.” Former Apple employees say they were generally prohibited from engaging with most outside groups.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="101" data-total-count="31821" itemprop="articleBody">“There’s a real culture of secrecy here that influences everything,” the former executive said.</p><div  class="ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent"><div class="accessibility-ad-header visually-hidden">

Apple is one of the most admired brands. In a national survey conducted by The New York Times in November, 56 percent of respondents said they couldn’t think of anything negative about Apple. Fourteen percent said the worst thing about the company was that its products were too expensive. Just 2 percent mentioned overseas labor practices.</p><button class="button comments-button  theme-speech-bubble" data-skip-to-para-id="story-continues-17">
</button><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="303" data-total-count="33180" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-17">People like Ms. White of Harvard say that until consumers demand better conditions in overseas factories — as they did for companies like Nike and Gap, which today have overhauled conditions among suppliers — or regulators act, there is little impetus for radical change. Some Apple insiders agree.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="259" data-total-count="33439" itemprop="articleBody">“You can either manufacture in comfortable, worker-friendly factories, or you can reinvent the product every year, and make it better and faster and cheaper, which requires factories that seem harsh by American standards,” said a current Apple executive.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="94" data-total-count="33533" itemprop="articleBody">“And right now, customers care more about a new iPhone than working conditions in China.”</p>
